    "description": "With supportive cushioning built for a smooth run, the Nike InfinityRN 4 is a brand-new take on a familiar favourite. It's made from our all-new Nike ReactX foam, which gives you 13% more energy return compared with Nike React foam, to help you stay fresh and bouncy. (What's more? Nike ReactX reduces the carbon footprint of the midsole by at least 43% compared with Nike React foam, so it helps support the planet, too). We coupled the ReactX foam with Nike Running's best-fitting Flyknit yet, so you can take off any time, anywhere with secure upper support and breathability. It's the kind of shoe that can grant you that priceless peace of mind to go faster and further, thanks to an intuitive design that supports every stride."
